    /Bug: displays wrong episode
        looks like a refresh problem. I think because the track isn't changing the display isn't updating to the current episode.
        get debug display working (with curses)
            why does display clear?
                is the refresh command in debug in the wrong place?

    /Bug: crashing on Fiona's episodes when it hits the first track with an error from curses in show_favourite

    /create default location for data directory

Refactor: use an event queue
Make rapid repeated navigation work instead of looping on the same track

Factor out EPISODE_DIRECTORY (just use DATA_DIRECTORY and search for sub-directories)

Tidy up the superfluous code in "lj_download_segments

Add performers to data extracted from Late Junction XML

Add performer data to the exported favourited file

Add fast-forward / rewind (I can't skip DJ chat)

A display button to cycle through display options:

    + episode
    
Save location when quitting on paus

Create "heard" field and persist

Separate segment download from parsing

Put extra fields in at the parsing stage



create a while True main loop (around the current while loop)

Find a way to show the "2/18" when navigating without it being instantly overwritten by the track name. 


Clear the GPIO when the programme exits.
